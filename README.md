- **Manual/AI Hybrid:** Allow users to set preferences but also offer smart, dynamic adjustments.

### 2. Goal Tracking and Progress Visualization
- **Multi-level Goals:** Support for short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals.
- **Goal Breakdown:** Decompose goals into actionable tasks and subtasks.
- **Progress Metrics:** Visual progress bars, streaks, and completion rates.
- **Reflection Prompts:** Periodic check-ins and end-of-day/weekly reflections.

### 3. Habit Integration
- **Habit Stacking:** Suggest habit chains and routines based on user behavior.
- **Reminders & Nudges:** Smart notifications for habit reminders, streak-saving, and encouragement.
- **Analytics:** Visualize habit consistency, identify bottlenecks, and suggest improvements.

### 4. AI-Powered Smart Suggestions
- **Prioritization:** Recommend which tasks to tackle based on urgency, importance, deadlines, and user energy.
- **Automatic Rescheduling:** Propose optimal times to reschedule tasks when conflicts or fatigue are detected.
- **Break & Focus Recommendations:** Suggest Pomodoro/focus sessions, breaks, and movement based on attention span data.
- **Context Awareness:** Adapt to meetings, travel, and life events imported from connected calendars.

### 5. Minimalist, Distraction-Free Interface

- **Task Managers:** Optional sync with Todoist, Notion, Trello, etc.
- **Health & Wearables:** Integration with Apple Health, Google Fit, Oura, WHOOP, etc. to correlate schedule with sleep, activity, and biometrics.

### 7. Advanced Analytics & Reporting
- **Personal Insights:** Weekly/monthly analytics dashboards (productivity trends, energy patterns, goal progress).
- **Custom Reports:** Exportable PDF/CSV reports for goal achievement and habit tracking.
- **Privacy-First:** All analytics are user-owned, with strong privacy controls.

### 8. Security & Privacy
